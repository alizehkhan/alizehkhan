# Good design is about managing attention

I'm a Frontend Engineer and Designer. I build and advocate for web experiences that prioritise content, inclusivity and simplicity.

I code in `react` `typescript` `css` `html`

I am nerdy about `design systems` `accessibility` `form ux`.

❤️ First intuitive, then discoverable.

🧡 Choose the least powerful language suitable for the job.

💛 Design that respects convention over novelty

💚 No abstraction is better than the wrong abstraction.

💙 Use case coverage over code coverage.
