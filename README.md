# I'm a Frontend Engineer and Designer. I build and advocate for web experiences that prioritise content, inclusivity and simplicity.

I code in `html` `css` `typescript` `react`.

I am nerdy about `design systems` `accessibility` `form ux`.

❤️ Good interaction design is about managing attention.

🧡 First intuitive, then discoverable.

💛 Choose the least powerful language suitable for the job.

💚 Design that respects convention over novelty

💙 No abstraction is better than the wrong abstraction.

💜 Use case coverage over code coverage.
